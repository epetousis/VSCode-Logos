VSCode-Logos
=============

Logos syntax highlighter for Visual Studio Code.

Run `git clone https://github.com/evilgoldfish/VSCode-Logos $HOME/.vscode/extensions/logos` and reload VSCode (close and reopen). You should now have syntax highlighting for logos.

* It could be better, a lot better. I do not know regexes enough to fix it, but if anyone feels like contributing, it would be appreciated.
